In the realm of computing, endianness refers to the specific arrangement of bytes within a word of digital data, whether stored in computer memory or transmitted through a data communication medium. This concept is elegantly categorized as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE), terms introduced by Danny Cohen in a 1980 publication known as an Internet Experiment Note. The term "endian" itself traces its origins back to the writings of 18th-century Anglo-Irish author Jonathan Swift. In his 1726 novel, Gulliver's Travels, Swift skillfully illustrates the division among sects of Lilliputians based on the method they employ to break the shell of a boiled egg â€“ either from the big end or the little end.

In the intricate landscape of computers, information is stored in groups of binary bits with varying sizes. Each group is assigned a numerical address that serves as the computer's means of accessing the data. On contemporary computers, the smallest data group with an address is an eight-bit byte. Larger groups consist of two or more bytes, such as a 32-bit word comprising four bytes. The choice of how a computer numbers individual bytes within a larger group, starting from either end, gives rise to two prevalent types of endianness in digital electronic engineering. The initial selection of endianness in a new design may be somewhat arbitrary, yet subsequent technological revisions maintain consistency with the existing endianness to ensure backward compatibility.

In a big-endian system, the most significant byte of a word resides at the smallest memory address, while the least significant byte finds its place at the largest address. Conversely, a little-endian system stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Of these two, big-endian aligns more closely with the left-to-right writing style of English, as digits are compared to bytes. Bi-endianness emerges as a feature supported by numerous computer architectures, allowing for switchable endianness in data and instruction fetches. Other orderings are broadly termed middle-endian or mixed-endian.

Big-endianness prevails in networking protocols, notably within the Internet protocol suite, where it is aptly termed network order, prioritizing the transmission of the most significant byte first. In contrast, little-endianness dominates processor architectures (such as x86, most ARM implementations, and base RISC-V implementations) and their associated memory. File formats may adopt either ordering, with some using a combination or including an indicator specifying the ordering used throughout the file.
